## Folder Structure

- Each competition has its own folder.

  - Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing my analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
  - Scripts: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, etc.
  - Data: Sample or processed data used for the competition (if applicable).
  - Other resources: Additional files that might be useful for understanding the competition and my approach.
